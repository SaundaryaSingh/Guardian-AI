"""Financial router tools — LLM sub-agent pattern (Dexter-inspired).

Each router exposes a single natural-language ``query`` parameter to the main LLM.
Internally it runs a focused inner LLM that has access to specialized data tools,
calls them in parallel, and returns the combined result.

Data source status:
  ✅ yfinance          - US/global quotes, historical data, fundamentals
  ✅ akshare           - Chinese A-share quotes, historical, financials, sectors, indices
  ✅ sec_edgar         - SEC EDGAR 10-Q/10-K filings (daily list, ticker filings, full parse)
  ✅ earnings_calendar - Earnings dates, EPS surprises, consensus estimates, revisions
