"""Prediction Market Router — LLM sub-agent for prediction market queries (Dexter pattern).

The public ``PredictionMarketRouter`` accepts a natural-language query, runs an
inner LLM with ``PredictionMarketTool`` as the sole inner tool, and returns
a synthesised prediction market analysis.

Routes to:
  - PredictionMarketDataTool (Polymarket + Kalshi) for market data
