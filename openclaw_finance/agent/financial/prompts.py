# ===== Macro analysis tool routing =====
MACRO_ROUTING_PROMPT = """[System Context - Macro Analysis Tools]

For macroeconomic queries, use these tools in order:
1. `economics_data` (command="indicators") — fetches live FRED data: GDP, CPI, unemployment, \
fed funds, yield spread, credit spread, VIX, and more. No web search needed.
2. `economics_data` (command="fx_rates") — live FX rates via yfinance.
3. `economics_data` (command="yields") — treasury yield curve (3m, 2y, 5y, 10y, 30y).
4. `economics_data` (command="commodity") — oil, gold, copper, etc.
5. `economics_data` (command="calendar") — economic release calendar: what macro data is being \
released today or this week, with latest and prior values. Use start_date/end_date for range.
6. `economics_analysis` — run CFA-level analysis models (market_cycles, policy_analysis, \
growth_analysis, statistical_analysis, etc.) on the fetched data.

IMPORTANT — CPI indicator keys:
- `cpi_yoy` → YoY inflation rate (e.g. 2.8%) — USE THIS for inflation analysis, Taylor rule, cycle detection
- `core_cpi_yoy` → YoY core inflation rate (ex food & energy)
- `cpi` / `core_cpi` → raw CPI index level (~326) — only use for price-level analysis, NOT inflation rate

For "what macro data is being released today/this week" questions, use \
economics_data(command="calendar"). It returns only market-moving releases \
(CPI, GDP, NFP, FOMC, PCE, JOLTS, etc.) — not daily noise. \
Do NOT use economics_analysis for calendar/release questions — it runs \
statistical models (ARIMA, cycles), not release lookups.

Do NOT use web_search to look up FRED series pages or macro data. \
The economics_data tool fetches directly from the FRED API and yfinance."""


# ===== Meme coin tool routing =====
MEME_ROUTING_PROMPT = """[System Context - Meme Coin Tools]

The user has a meme coin related query. Use the `meme` tool with a natural-language query.

QUERY EXAMPLES:
- "What's the price of BONK?" → meme(query="Get BONK price and market data")
- "What meme coins are trending?" → meme(query="Show currently trending meme coins")
- "Tell me about Dogecoin" → meme(query="Get detailed info and contract address for Dogecoin")
- "Find meme coin launch ideas" → meme(query="Scan social media for meme coin launch candidates")
- "Check trending tweets for meme ideas" → meme(query="Scan Twitter and RSS for viral meme coin ideas")
- "Analyze this tweet for meme potential" → meme(query="Analyze this tweet for meme potential: <tweet>")
- "Check Polymarket signals" → meme(query="Check Polymarket for meme catalyst signals")

WHEN NOT TO USE THIS TOOL (answer directly):
- "What is a meme coin?" — educational question, answer from knowledge
- "How do meme coins work?" — conceptual explanation

FOR TOKEN CREATION (deploy / launch / mint / create a coin):
Read the `meme-create` skill (listed in your Skills section) for the step-by-step workflow.
It tells you which fields to collect from the user and how to format the creation query.
Do NOT call `meme` for creation until name, symbol, description, and image_path are confirmed.

IMPORTANT:
- For brainstorming/scanning, present candidates for the user to choose from.
- Higher meme_score = higher viral potential. Scores below 3 are filtered out by default."""


# ===== Prediction market tool routing =====
PREDICTION_ROUTING_PROMPT = """[System Context - Prediction Market Tools]

The user has a prediction market query. Use the `prediction_market` tool with a natural-language query.

QUERY EXAMPLES:
- "What prediction markets are trending?" -> prediction_market(query="Show trending prediction markets by volume")
- "Compare odds on Fed rate cut" -> prediction_market(query="Compare Polymarket and Kalshi odds on Fed rate decision")
- "Show me election markets on Polymarket" -> prediction_market(query="Search for election prediction markets on Polymarket")
- "What are the odds of a recession?" -> prediction_market(query="Search for recession prediction markets and show probabilities")
- "Show probability history for Trump winning" -> prediction_market(query="Get historical probability data for Trump election market")
- "How has the probability of X changed in the past month?" -> prediction_market(query="Search for X prediction market and show 1-month probability history and change")
- "What categories of markets exist on Kalshi?" -> prediction_market(query="List available market categories on Kalshi")

SELF-DISCOVERY: The tool can find markets by topic without a URL. For any probability \
history or change query, pass a descriptive query and the tool will search for the \
market, find its slug, and fetch the history automatically. Do NOT ask the user for \
a Polymarket URL, slug, or contract identifier — the tool handles discovery itself.

FOR CHARTS (plot / graph / visualize probability or odds over time):
Read the `odds-chart` skill for the step-by-step workflow.
Do NOT attempt to chart without reading the skill first.

WHEN NOT TO USE THIS TOOL (answer directly):
- "What is a prediction market?" -- educational question, answer from knowledge
- "How do prediction markets work?" -- conceptual explanation
- "Is Polymarket legal?" -- regulatory question, answer from knowledge

IMPORTANT:
- Probabilities represent market-implied likelihoods, NOT objective forecasts.
- For cross-platform comparison, the compare command finds similar markets on both Polymarket and Kalshi.
- Polymarket prices are 0-1 scale (0.65 = 65% implied probability).
- Kalshi prices are also normalised to 0-1 scale (0.65 = 65% implied probability)."""


# ===== Cache reuse context injection =====
CACHE_REUSE_CONTEXT_PROMPT = """[System Context - Cached Financial Data]

Previously computed analysis results are available. If the user's question \
can be answered using this cached data, reference it directly instead of \
calling tools again. Mention the analysis date so the user knows data freshness.

{cached_results}

You can read full analysis files using the read_file tool if needed."""
